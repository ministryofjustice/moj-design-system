Use the progress bar component to show users which stage of the journey they're at.

{{ dsExample({
  name: 'progress-bar',
  example: 'default',
  height: 175
}) }}

## When to use this component

Progress bars can be used at the entry and exit points of a transaction to illustrate the user's location within a larger service journey.

When a user completes a transaction, the done page should include a progress bar. When a user is invited to return to complete another transaction within the service journey, the landing page should also include a progress bar.

## When not to use this component

Progress bars are not used to show individual steps within a transaction, or used as a navigation within a transaction.

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the progress bar component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks macro.
