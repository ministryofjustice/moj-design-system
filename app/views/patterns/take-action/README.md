Help users take action.

## Identity bar

<img src="/public/images/patterns/take-action-identity-bar.png">

Put actions in the [Identity Bar](/components/identity-bar/) when users may want to take action from any sub section of a system.

## Page heading actions

<img src="/public/images/patterns/take-action-page-header-actions.png">

Use the [Page Header Actions](/components/page-header-actions/) to put actions next to the h1 when users need to take action relating to something on a specific screen and only when there's one thing on that screen, like a list of people.

## Buttons within the body

Put buttons in close proximity to the component it relates to when you have more than one component on a page.

If the component is tall or can grow tall, put the buttons above the component like in the [filter a list](/patterns/filter-a-list/) pattern.

If the component is short, put the buttons below.

## Minimise distraction when taking action

When selecting an action, users should be taken to a [question page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/) without sub navigation if applicable to reduce noise.

You can include a cancel link below the continue button to help users leave a multi-page flow more easily.

## Handling repeated actions

If the user has to perform the same action repeatedly, the user should be taken back to where they started with [success message](/components/banner/) being shown at the top of the page.

If the user performs the action infrequently or it's a final or significant action, show users a [confirmation page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/confirmation-pages/)

## Handling infrequent or dangerous actions

If the user is performing an important action or if that action is taken infrequently, show users a [check answers](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers) page followed by a [confirmation page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/confirmation-pages).

## Do not put actions inside navigation menus

Don't put actions within the [primary navigation](/components/primary-navigation/) or [sub navigation](/components/sub-navigation/).
