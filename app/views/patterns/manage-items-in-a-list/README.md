## Guidance

### When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when users need to perform the same action on a list repeatedly.

For example, instead of making users share an individual case, they can do multiple cases at the same time. This is because users need to share multiple cases with same group of people.

### How it works

The user selects the items they want to action. Then selects one of the actions at the top.

The action might take the user down a flow. Or if the action can be performed immediately without further questions, show a [success message](/components/banner/) at the top of the page.

#### Select all

Consider letting users select all the items in a list. When within a table, put the select all checkbox in the table heading.

### Gaps in the pattern

- being able to manage items one at a time, without multiple selection. Such as buttons and links in each row. Or when to click an item before editing it.
- alternative patterns to tables. Such as a timeline or a list of items shown as cards.

### Research on this pattern

We need more research. If you have used the support, get in touch to share your research findings.
