## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern to help users search for something within a system. For example, a case in a case working system.

This pattern is especially helpful when users need to be able to search from anywhere as it's accessible from any page.

## Search everything

Users expect to be able to search for anything and by any keyword.

If you must limit what the user can search for, use a specific label and hint. For example:

- label could be “Find person”
- hint could be “Enter person's last name or identification number”

## Advanced search

Don't provide users with an advanced search page. Users prefer to search and _then_ refine their results. To do this, let users [filter their results](/patterns/filter-a-list/).

## Research on this pattern

We need more research. If you have used the search pattern, get in touch to share your research findings.
