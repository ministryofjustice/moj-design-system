Any websites published since September 2018 need to meet accessibility standards and publish an accessibility statement.

MOJ will need to publish accessibility statements for each service, which will be linked from the service footer.

## What the statement needs to cover

The statement must:

- clearly state the level of accessibility across the site or app
- list any inaccessible parts of the website or app, and explain why they are not accessible
- tell users with access needs about alternative routes, or how to request accessible versions
- provide details on who to contact to report accessibility issues
- explain the procedure if people are not happy with the response
- be in an accessible and consistent format
- be updated annually

## Accessibility statement template

GDS will be supplying a template which we will adapt and use.

This will make sure the statement is published in a fully accessible and consistent format, which is another requirement of the regulations.

They are user-testing the format with people with access needs so they can be sure the statements are clearly understood and meet user needs.

They are finalising the template and will publish it on GOV.UK in the new year.

## What services need to do

Services need to review and test their websites for user accessibility now.

This will make sure you are prepared to meet the new regulations and will have all the information needed for your statement.

You should include users with access needs and those using assistive technologies in this activity and schedule this on a regular basis.

When fixing issues with your online services and published content make sure they meet the key acceptance criteria of the European or international standards (respectively, [EN 301 549](http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard) and [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)).

## Background

The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 came into force on 23 September 2018. It aims to ensure public sector websites and mobile apps are accessible to all users, especially those with disabilities.

Any websites published since September 2018 will need a statement by September 2019, while older websites have until 2020 to comply.
