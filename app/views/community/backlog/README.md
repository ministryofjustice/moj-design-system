The Design System is built upon the research and experience of teams across the Ministry of Justice.

Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or improvements to existing ones.

The [community backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system-backlog/issues) contains a list of components, patterns and updates. They can be:

- **Proposed** – someone has suggested a new component or pattern
- **To do** – the proposed component or pattern has been agreed and is ready to work on
- **In progress** – someone is actively working on the component or pattern

You can discuss the existing styles, components and patterns in the Design System, or ones being developed, by commenting on issues in the [community backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system-backlog/projects/1).

For example, you can:

- ask questions about a style, component or pattern
- answer questions from other contributors
- share examples or demos of a component or pattern
- share research relating to a style, component or pattern

Alternatively, you can email design-system@digital.justice.gov.uk.
